# A Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) Model for Image Recognition of Hot Dogs!

This repot contains the products of our General Assembley group hackthon project to create an image recognition convoluted neural network model to detect the presence, lor lack there of, a hotdog in an image file.


Feel free to try and stump the model!!!

(More to come in the readme soon)
